# Stuff that I made for Discord

The plugins were made to be used with [Powercord](https://powercord.dev).

To use custom stylesheets, install Powercord, [BandagedBD](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp), or [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord).

Only tested on Linux with Powercord. Modifying Discord goes against their TOS so ***use at your own risk***.

# Plugins

## Lightswitch

A tiny plugin that allows you to set light and dark appearance from chat and from the Javascript console.

Chat command Usage:  
```
.lightswitch
.lightswitch light
.lightswitch dark
```

DevTools Usage: (open console with `ctrl+shift+i`)  
```js
Lightswitch.set('light') // AAAAAH MY EYES!!!
Lightswitch.set('dark') // much better ðŸ˜Ž
Lightswitch.toggle() // shorthand
```

# Themes

## Bliss

Sleek, flat theme with support for both light and dark modes. Colors can be modified in the `.theme-dark` and `.theme-light` sections. It requires window transparency for optimal appearance.

If you would like to use colors generated by [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) there is an SCSS file provided which you will need to compile on each update of pywal.
